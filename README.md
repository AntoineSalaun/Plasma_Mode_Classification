# Plasma_Mode_Classification
The project was done within the Machine Learning course offered at the *School of Computer and Communication Sciences* at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).</br>
It focuses on the classification of tokamak plasma confinement states (*Low*, *High* and *Dithering*): ***convolutional recurrent neural networks*** were implemented especially according to the following paper:
